### ECMAScript 6: Feature Overview &amp; Comparison

This is the source of the website [es6-features.org](http://es6-features.org/),
a small overview of [ECMAScript 6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts) language features and a comparison to
the older/traditional [ECMAScript 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf) equivalents. It was setup by
computer scientist and software architect [Ralf S. Engelschall](rse@engelschall.com) in order to promote ECMAScript 6 in
the software engineering projects around him.
