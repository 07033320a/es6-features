### ECMAScript 6: Feature Overview &amp; Comparison

This is the source of the website [es6-features.org](http://es6-features.org/),
a small overview of ECMAScript 6 language features and a comparison to
the older/traditional ECMAScript 5 equivalents. It was setup by software
architect Ralf S. Engelschall in order to promote ECMAScript 6 in
the software engineering projects around him.
